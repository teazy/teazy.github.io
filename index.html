				<p> Hey! I'm Randy Tran the one and only. I was a football player for bolton but sadly I was injured, I could've went pro. The many hobbies I have are laughing at my own jokes. Being a lonely guy. Netflix professional. Really I am just a guy who wants to make the world a better place. My main goal is to become really well renown and wealthy, then travel to less fortunate countries to build up schools. Creating a chance for every kid in the world to have education at their disposal. This also help me achieve my other goal as to travel around the world! Oh and did I forget to mention that I want to win about 6 oscars?
